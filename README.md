## App Description:
GhostWriterz was created to help artists with writer's block get a quick and fun song idea. Being a music artist myself, I understand how it can be hard for 
others to come up with the perfect words to use in a song. With GhostWriterz, you can now find, save, create, and share lyrics anytime, anywhere! Lyrics can be
ranked once shared to the GhostWriterz database, and the app will include a community ranking system where the more lyrics you share, the higher you rank!
