        <p>As music artists, we sometimes lose creativity dealing with our day to day lives. That inspiration we're looking for to 
            write a good song just isn't there, and GhostWriterz is here to solve that problem. No more banging the tables and wasting time
            forcing up words when you can find lyrics from a community of helpful artists! On a roll? feeling like the next Shakespeare?
            Share your lyrics to the community for others to use to help them out of writers block.
